<summary> üê≥ Getting started with Docker Compose</summary><br>

```bash
docker-compose up -d
docker exec -it one_for_all bash
npm test 
```

<summary>üê≥ More information</summary><br>

- `docker-compose up -d`
  - Starts the `node` and `db` services
    - These services will start up a container named `one_for_all` and another named `one_for_all_db`.
    - When starting for the first time, docker builds the `node` service image, installing the necessary Node dependencies for the automated evaluation
- `docker exec -it one_for_all bash
  - Access the container's command line `one_for_all`
    - this gives access to the interactive terminal of the container created by compose, which is running in the background

<summary>üìñ Database business rules</summary><br />

Your database must follow business rules and be able to recover:

- Information about which plans are available and their details;
  - Each user can have only one plan.

- Information about all artist persons;
  - An artist person can have several albums;
  - An artist person can be followed by several user people

- Information about all albums by each artist;
  - For the purposes of this project, consider that each album has only one person as the main artist;
  - Each album has several songs.

- Information about all songs from each album;
  - For the purposes of this project, consider that each song is contained in only one album.

- Information about all users, their plans, their playback history and followed artists.
  - A user can have only one plan;
  
- Each song in the playback history can appear only once per person (for simplicity, consider that the purpose of the history is to know **which** songs have already been played and **not how many times** they have been played);
  
- A user person can follow multiple artist people, but each artist person can be followed only once per user person.
